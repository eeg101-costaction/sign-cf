## Validity and scientific integrity in times of rapidly evolving practices

Increased computational power and technology-assisted data mining allows massively testing data on each and every possible time x electrode x frequency (...) combination. The availability of increasingly flexible tools that allow for the easy redefinition of statistical tests with a mouse click makes it a real challenge to maintain valid standards, compromising the soundness and reproducibility of research. As human neuroscience increasingly integrates AI and machine learning approaches for data processing and analyses ([DuPre & Poldrack, 2024](references.md#DuPre2024)) we must be critical about the epistemological assumptions underlying these technologies. Below, we advocate agreed-upon standard practices using open science tools and resources grounded in theoretically elaborated research.

### Research practices and reproducible[^1] science

Research practices are fundamental to scientific inquiry, and their proper application ensures reliable, reproducible, and openly extensible science.

    type: info
    
Over the last 15 years, neuroscience has reckoned with how questionable research and publication practices inflate false positive rates and erode trust in scientific findings [(Nosek et al., 2012)](references.md#Nosek2012). Community-driven efforts have highlighted specific challenges and offered some solutions ([Niso, Botvinik-Nezer, et al., 2022](references.md#Niso2022a); [Niso, Krol, et al., 2022](references.md#Niso2022b); [Pernet et al., 2020](references.md#Pernet2020); [Simmons et al., 2012](references.md#Simmons2012)), general  manifestos [(Munafò et al., 2017)](references.md#Munafo2017) and pledges ([Schönbrodt et al. 2015](references.md#Shönbrodt2015)). Despite the creation of national and international networks to initiate and support relevant communities (e.g. [UK Reproducibility Network](https://www.ukrn.org/){:target="_blank"}; [ARIADNE](https://igor-biodgps.github.io/ARIADNE/contentpages/intro.html){:target="_blank"}; [the Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/index.html){:target="_blank"}) fully reproducible science is far from being the norm in empirical science in general [(Lakens et al., 2024)](references.md#Lakens2024) or EEG research in particular. 

To make progress, adopting standardized protocols for data collection, processing, and statistical analysis is essential for ensuring robust, replicable findings in EEG. At the same time, keeping high standards and re-shaping publication practices—supporting non-profit and scientifically sound publishing initiatives (e.g. open access nonprofit platforms like [Peer Community In](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/){:target="_blank"}), while avoiding opaque or predatory outlets—is critical to maintain the overall quality and credibility of EEG science.

/// details | 1.2. Standardization and Documentation of Data
    type: info

Generating large, annotated, and openly accessible EEG data repositories, including clinical and neuroimaging data, is crucial for advancing basic and applied neuroscience. This facilitates discovery science, improves diagnostic applications, industry applications and educational settings, promoting learning and skill development among students and early-career researchers. By pooling resources and sharing data, we enable researchers to perform large-scale analyses that are otherwise impractical for individual laboratories. Standardising datasets, using the Brain Imaging Data Structure ([BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"}), is a crucial stage that fosters FAIR science ([Wilkinson et al., 2016](references.md#Wilkinson2016)). To promote transparency, we suggest sharing not only raw data but also analysis scripts and detailed metadata. Platforms such as [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/){:target="_blank"}, [g-node GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/){:target="_blank"}, [OSF](https://osf.io/){:target="_blank"}, or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/){:target="_blank"} can be used to facilitate this process while ensuring adherence to FAIR principles. Such repositories provide diverse datasets that can help uncover new patterns, validate findings across different populations, and improve the generalizability of results. 

Moreover, open data repositories are invaluable for developing and refining diagnostic applications. They provide the necessary volume and variety of data to train machine learning algorithms and develop robust biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric conditions.

/// details | 1.3. Open Science and Open Source
    type: info

Using transparent approaches, making sure that results and data are accessible is an essential feature of science. Open science is a broad movement in contemporary science that promotes open access to all aspects of the scientific process. Provided that participants' privacy is protected, we generally advocate for open science practices.

Of particular interest to the EEG community, it is important to consider that EEG data requires elaborate software to perform increasingly complex analyses. Open-source (OS) software and hardware are vital in advancing EEG research. By supporting and contributing to Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) and Open-Source Hardware (OSH), we encourage community transparency, collaboration, and innovation. Open-source tools allow researchers to inspect, modify, and improve code and designs, leading to more robust and reliable scientific instruments and analyses. At the same time, OS fosters the development and sharing of cutting-edge methods and makes it easy to attribute developers for their contributions. This collective effort enhances the reproducibility of our work, accelerates scientific progress, and promotes a culture of openness and mutual support in the EEG community. Furthermore, open-source and open-sciences initiatives lower barriers to entry for researchers worldwide, especially those in resource-limited settings. By making software, hardware and knowledge freely available, we democratize access to cutting-edge tools, promoting inclusivity and diversity in EEG science (also see Democratization section below).

At the same time, high standards and best practice in developing and using OS scientific software must be maintained to harvest its full potential (see [Westner et al., 2024](references.md#Westner2024))

### Interpretable and theoretically well-grounded research

For EEG research to drive meaningful progress, it must be grounded in current theories and integrate insights from multiple disciplines. This is especially crucial as AI tools and models become increasingly prominent in the field.

/// details | 1.4. Theory-driven and data-driven research
    type: info 

Recent years have seen an increasing emphasis on ever-larger datasets ([Frégnac, 2017](references.md#Fregnac2017)) with insufficient attention to the theoretical underpinnings that might explain brain activity and its emergent properties ([Borsboom et al., 2021](references.md#Borsboom2021); [Eronen & Bringmann, 2021](references.md#Eronen2021); [Gerstner et al., 2012](references.md#Gerstner2012)). 

From a philosophical or epistemological standpoint, it is vital to recognize the limits of any single perspective, emphasizing instead frameworks that integrate dynamic, second-person interaction as central to cognition ([Hinrichs et al., 2025](references.md#Hinrichs2025)). A purely data-driven understanding of neuroscience—particularly one focused on individual-brain analysis—can be limited in scope ([Forest 2013](references.md#Forest2013)). We therefore advocate for cultivating strong theoretical neuroscience foundations and for interdisciplinary exchanges that draw insights from fields such as philosophy, anthropology, psychology, the arts, and the humanities. These cross-pollinations could yield innovative frameworks that enrich our uses and interpretations of EEG data.

In addition, the considerations outlined here link closely with our broader calls for epistemological rigor (see also Section 3 - Responsibility). Effective science requires the “how” of sound methods and robust protocols, and the “why”: the political, social, and ethical relevance behind our research questions.

By grounding EEG research in a well-articulated theoretical framework and seeking contributions from diverse disciplines, we can enhance the explanatory power of our findings, enrich interpretation, and promote more meaningful progress in understanding the human brain.

/// details | 1.5. Transparent, interpretable, and explainable modeling 
    type: info 

A key challenge emerging for complex computational models—particularly those applied to data analysis and clinical decision-making—is ensuring their transparency, interpretability, and explainability. Modern ML/AI architectures often surpass our theoretical grasp [(Holzinger et al., 2022)](references.md#Holzinger2022), creating an epistemic gap where we rely on tools we cannot fully comprehend [(Cichy & Kaiser, 2019)](references.md#Cichy2019). To address this, the EEG community must dedicate basic research and advanced computational tools (see the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic or LIME approach as one such framework [(Ribeiro et al., 2016)](references.md#Ribeiro2016) to uncovering how these models operate, while simultaneously leveraging their potential to advance knowledge and applications.

Fostering interpretability and explainability requires a solid theoretical foundation and active collaboration across disciplines. The application of cross-validation with independent and diverse datasets will help mitigate overfitting and bias, increasing the likelihood that conclusions drawn from ML/AI models are reliable. We hence advocate for i) **diverse and open datasets** that will make sure AI models will be trained on neurophysiological data acquired from a wide range of population, cognitive states, and environmental contexts; ii) **interpretable AI models** that prioritise explainable AI/ML approaches rather than using black boxes; iii) **integrative validation methods** to acknowledge and incorporate in our models the fact that cognition cannot be meaningfully reduced to algorithmic patterns without considering the broader, complex organism-environment system.

Thus, by openly sharing parameters, feature-selection methods, and decision-making processes, we can build stronger trust within our community, mitigate algorithmic reductionism, and accelerate meaningful progress in ML/AI-driven EEG research.
